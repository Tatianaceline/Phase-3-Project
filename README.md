# Academic Performance Analysis Project
This project aims to explore the key factors influencing student academic performance using data analysis techniques. The focus is on understanding how different variables such as study time, absenteeism, health, and personal relationships impact student success.

## Project Overview
The analysis was performed using a dataset that includes various predictors of student performance. The goal was to identify which factors are most significant in determining academic success and to provide recommendations for improving student outcomes.

## Key Features:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The dataset was prepared for analysis by handling missing values and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries were used to understand the distribution of data and relationships between variables.
Predictive Modeling: Regression models were employed to quantify the impact of different factors on student performance.
Recommendations: Based on the analysis, several actionable recommendations were proposed to help improve academic outcomes.

## Conclusion
This project explores the key factors influencing student academic performance. Through data analysis, it identifies critical elements such as study habits, attendance, health, and personal relationships that significantly impact student success. By understanding these factors, educational institutions can implement targeted interventions to improve academic outcomes. The findings underscore the importance of a holistic approach to education, where support systems are in place to foster both the academic and personal well-being of students.
